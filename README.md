Rivals of Aether Workshop Reader and Helper
==========================================

**Rivals Reader** is a Python script I wrote to day that helps you obtain data about the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/383980/workshop/) content you currently have downloaded on your PC.

If you are a creator of content, then you likely enjoy poking around through other users Characters and Stages to have a look under the hood.
If you decide you want to edit this content on the fly, then you also have to create copies of everything in your `%APPDATA%` folder, as this is where the game is checking for local content. _(See the [official documentation](https://rivalsofaether.com/introduction/) for more detailed info on this and everything else!)_
